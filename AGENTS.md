# Repository engineering notes

- Route `ServerEvent` values through the shared event-to-thread-ID logic. Events such as
  `thread.updated` carry the ID in `event.thread.id`, while message, request, terminal,
  and error events carry it in `event.threadId`. When adding an event variant, update
  the shared routing logic and its regression tests so WebSocket and CLI subscribers
  receive the same events.
